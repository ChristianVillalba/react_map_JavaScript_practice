Created with [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/).

## Description
This app creates and prints in the console: 
* An Array with String Objects
* Each String Object will be the first 100 characters of the meaning of each emoji.

How it works:
* Emojipedia.js stores an array called emojipedia, it is composed by Objects
* Each Object in emojipedia.js have a property called "meaning"
* We import the emojipedia to our index.js
* The map function in index.js will return an array with as many String Objects as Objects it can find in the emojipedia.js file.
* Each String Object will be the first 100 characters in the meaning property 


## What I have learned with this project:
* Use of map function
  * What map function returns and how it works
* Creting substrings
